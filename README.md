# AcceptanceTests

Here are some of the acceptance test I have written for the projects I have developed for my internship. This tests are aimed to assert that basic functionalites of a given program is working as expected. All test files can be found under the tests folder with .js extension, each of which has a corresponding name to the actual github repo in my profile.
